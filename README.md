2017 RecyclerView Tutorial by Ryan Kay (wiseAss).

Welcome to my Android RecyclerView Tutorial. About a year ago, I got so pissed off at how overly complicated it was to get a decent RecyclerView running (which is also my fault for not being a better learner), that I decided to make series on Youtube about it. Much to my surprise, my long winded explanations and random tangents was something that a few people actually enjoyed. 

While I didn't make any MAJOR mistakes with the old tutorial, I was still pretty much a Junior Developer on the Android Platform at that point. Since then, I've learned a great deal about making Android Apps, and even more about teaching people how to make them; so here you have it. 

Please bare in mind that while I'm getting ok at this Android thing, there's always room to learn. If there's anything in my Code which strikes you as being wrong or sub-optimal, please open a GitHub Issue and let me know about it! Bonus points if you take the time to actually explain why I'm wrong; I don't have a lot of spare time and I appreciate good feedback when I can get it.
